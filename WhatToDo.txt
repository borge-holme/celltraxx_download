To run CellTraxx, see the user manual. The preparation procedure includes copying the entire folder "celltraxx_system" to the root of the local C drive such that its path becomes "C:\celltraxx_system". The below mentioned videos should in sequence be copied into a new folder "C:\celltraxx_data". 

Two example video files are given in the folder "Example_videos_for_testing":

1_Random_migration_HeLa_cells.avi
Migrating HeLa cells captured every 10 minutes for 14 hours in Incucyte S3. Pixel size 1.24 µm. 

2_Wound-healing_PC-3_cells.avi
A wound healing experiment with PC-3 cells, imaged every 5 minutes for 15 hours. Pixel size 1.24 µm.


To allow the user to check that CellTraxx runs as intended, all the results files after processing the above two videos are stored in the folder "Example_videos_for_testing_Results". To run CellTraxx on the first example video with the same settings as in the results files, copy the text from the file "1_celltraxx_defaults.txt" in the folder "Example_videos_for_testing" to the file "celltraxx_defaults.txt" in the folder "C:\celltraxx_system". Copy the first avi video file into the folder "C:\celltraxx_data". Then run CellTraxx through ImageJ/Fiji as described in the manual. 

To run the second example video, remove the first video from the "C:\celltraxx_data" folder and paste in the second video. Copy the text from the file "2_celltraxx_defaults.txt" in the folder "Example_videos_for_testing" to the file "celltraxx_defaults.txt" in "C:\celltraxx_system", and run CellTraxx again from ImageJ/Fiji. 

Results from the exmpale videos are included in the manuscript Figure 2-3 and Figure S1-2 for 1_Random_migration_HeLa_cells.avi and as one of the replicate samples in Figure 8c-f.
